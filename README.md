# triple-edit

This is a Django application for editing RDF data created for the [2014 VIVO Conference Apps and Tools workshop](https://www.etouches.com/ehome/80403/189150/).  It's a proof-of-concept designed with the [VIVO](http://vivoweb.org) research networking system in mind, but in principle, it should work with any triplestore that supports SPARQL read queries and SPARQL updates from Python code.

## Functionality

 * [ckeditor](http://ckeditor.com/) for editing data properties containing text.

 * [Select2](http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2/) tagging widgets which allow for the easy lookup of entities and establishing relations with those.  In the sample application the [FAST](http://fast.oclc.org/searchfast/) web service is used to lookup skos:Concepts.

 * [HTML5 boilerplate](http://www.initializr.com/try) is used for responsive templating, which makes it mobile friendly.

## Use cases - what could I do with this?

 * create an application that allows researchers to manage and update [VIVO](http://vivoweb.org) research profiles.

 * create a mobile or tablet application that allows for straightforward editing of a subset of triplestore data by end users.

 * as a data curating or cleaning tool.  SPARQL queries could pull problematic data from your triplestore and the built in widgets (or new widgets) could be used by staff to clean or augment the data.

 * as an educational tool to learn more about SPARQL, ontologies and RDF.  Personal experience disclaimer: when you try to read and write RDF data directly, the learning happens hard but faster.

A [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMprPKBRCl4) is available on YouTube that highlights some of the functionality and motivations behind using an application like this to manage data in a triple store.

## Install

 * clone the repository
 * create a Python virtualenv and activate it
 * run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required modules
 * copy the `.sample-env` file to `.env` and adjust the settings to match your local environment
    * You will need access to a SPARQL endpoint for read queries
    * You will need access to a VIVO instance for writing data changes
 * run `python manage.py runserver` to start up the Django development serve
 * visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.  There should be a listing of people and organizations if your connection to a SPARQL endpoint is configured properly and there is people and organization data in the triple store you are querying.

## Dependencies

 * A SPARQL endpoint to issue queries against.  VIVO implementors should see [setting up a SPARQL endpoint](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/VIVO/Setting+up+a+VIVO+SPARQL+Endpoint).
 * A "backend" to write the updated data to.  See below.  This application was developed with [VIVO](http://vivoweb.org) in mind so there is a bundled VIVO backend that works with version of VIVO > 1.6.

## Development

To make ready use of this application, you would need access to a [VIVO](http://github.com/lawlesst/vivo-vagrant) instance with [sample data](http://github.com/lawlesst/vivo-sample-data).

If you are interested in using it with other triplestores (Sesame seems to be a good candidate, Fuesiki with updates turned on too) or applications, use the bundled `VivoBackend` as an example for writing your own backend.  Your own backend class it would need an `add_remove` method that accepts a RDFLib graph of additions and subtractions.  That's it.  Again, this is for demonstration purposes so it will require some tinkering and original code to connect to a different backend.
